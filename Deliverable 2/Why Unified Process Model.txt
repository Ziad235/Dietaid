The entire duration of our development process is about a month. For that reason, we believe the incremental nature of the Unified Process Model will be helpful in obtaining a working version of our project early on. Moreover, the flexibility provided by the process of iterations might be useful since there are many metrics which go into a diet (and therefore potential features to implement). This flexibility will allow us to change which of these metrics we are considering in our app during construction if necessary. Finally, since we don't expect the users to be technically savvy, the Unified Process Model's emphasis on the need for extensive documentation will help in producing high quality documentation for our users.
